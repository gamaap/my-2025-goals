My resolution for 2025 that I want to tackle :
- Consistently studying deep work about programming 4 hours a day.
- Become a modern and an expert front-end developer.
- Learn Guitar.
- Fluent at speaking English and Japanese.
- Create my first front-end portfolio by making real case projects.
- Take training / bootcamp to sharpen my programming skills.
- Save some money and list stuff that I need to buy later.
